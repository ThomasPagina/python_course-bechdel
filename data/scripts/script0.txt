Emilie and Amelie are talking about painting a wall together. How to organize the work, what the costs are, when they will start.
While on the surface this is their only topic, for both of them it is very clear, that they are talking about Sam. 
Sam is Emilie's former boyfriend, whom she would like to be with again, and he is Amelie's brother.
Amelie loves and adores Sam, but she thinks Emilie should be aware of his faults.
The wall they want to paint is the wall in the flat Sam and Emilie shared before, there are still traces of pictures they hang up there.
And there is still the whole in it, that was caused by Emilie throwing a flower pot, when she found out about all the lies Sam was telling her.
