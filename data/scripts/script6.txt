Sandra and Lara are discussing their food plans. Both are hungry. Sandra is considering a Pizza.
Lara would actually like something more healthy, but is settling on Pizza, because it is fast and she really is hungry.
Sandra finds out, that they could also have ice cream. So they settle on a menu: First Pizza (with some alibi tomatoes on top) and then ice cream.
