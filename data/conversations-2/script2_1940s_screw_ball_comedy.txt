[SCENE START]

**INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**

The room is bathed in the golden light of a setting sun, filtering through lace curtains. A small table holds a vase of wilting roses and two half-empty martini glasses. MARCIA, impeccably dressed in a floral dress, swirls her martini thoughtfully. ANNA, a little rumpled and wearing a practical cardigan, picks at a loose thread on the sofa.

**MARCIA:** (With a dramatic sigh) …and then Cousin Bartholomew, bless his cotton socks, tried to convince me he’d discovered a new species of beetle in the Cotswolds. A *beetle*, Anna! As if that’s the most pressing matter in the world.

**ANNA:** (Dryly) Well, it's certainly more pressing than finding a job, Marcia. Though, frankly, a beetle-finding cousin sounds preferable to a clerk in a munitions factory. 

**MARCIA:** Don’t be ridiculous. A clerk is respectable. Steady. Besides, I rather fancy the idea of teaching. Perhaps a finishing school for young ladies. Imagine, shaping futures! 

**ANNA:** (Taking a large gulp of her martini) Shaping futures while dodging shrapnel, you mean. I'm thinking something a bit more...utilitarian. Accounts. Or maybe even, dare I say it, radio repair. 

**MARCIA:** (Scoffs) Radio repair? You with your delicate hands? You’d break the tubes before you could even find them! 

**ANNA:** (Shrugs) A girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do, doesn’t she?  My Uncle Silas runs a little shop in Liverpool. Says they’re desperate for anyone with a smidge of technical know-how. 

A silence falls, punctuated only by the clinking of ice in the glasses. 

**MARCIA:** (Quietly) My mother… she worries.  She keeps sending me letters from Jersey.  About how I should marry a nice, solid man.  A doctor, perhaps.  Someone who can provide. 

**ANNA:** (Nods sympathetically)  It’s all anyone talks about, isn’t it?  Solid.  It’s exhausting.  My father... he just stares out at the sea. Doesn’t say much. 

The door creaks open, and MR. HENDERSON, a large, imposing man in a tweed suit, enters.

**MR. HENDERSON:** Marcia! Anna! Time for supper. And you two look like you've been wrestling with the Luftwaffe.

**MARCIA:** (Standing abruptly, smoothing her dress) Father! Just as we were… discussing the vital importance of beetles and the merits of radio repair. 

**ANNA:** (Rising too, a little reluctantly) Yes, well. Supper.  Always supper. 

Mr. Henderson surveys them both, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

**MR. HENDERSON:** (Gruffly) Don't let the supper cool. And for heaven’s sake, drink up.  You're both looking a bit peaked. 

He exits, leaving the two women alone once more in the fading light.
