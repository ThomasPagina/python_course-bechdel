[SCENE START]

**INT. APARTMENT - DAY**

Sunlight, thick and honeyed, pours through a lace-curtained window onto a room filled with dust motes and the lingering scent of lavender. The furniture is worn, a muted beige, and slightly askew. EMILIE (30s, dressed in a flowing, slightly stained linen dress) is meticulously measuring a length of painter’s tape with a ruler. AMELIE (30s, sharp-eyed, wearing a simple, dark sweater) sits on a threadbare armchair, nursing a cup of lukewarm tea. The wall behind her – the one in question – is visible, a faded expanse of pale green. It’s covered in the ghostly outlines of old photographs and postcards. A gaping hole, jagged and dark, punctuates the lower section.

**EMILIE**
(Without looking up)
Thirty-seven and a half. That’s the critical length. We need to account for the bevel, you understand? It’s not simply a matter of slapping it on. 

**AMELIE**
(Quietly)
It’s just a wall, Emilie. 

**EMILIE**
(Sighing, placing the tape down)
It’s *that* wall. It’s… a starting point. Like the first brushstroke.  Do you think we should prime it first? A light grey, perhaps? To even out the… the shadows. 

A long silence hangs in the air, punctuated by the ticking of an antique clock. 

**AMELIE**
(Taking a small sip of tea)
The cost of the primer… it’s surprisingly high.  And the paint itself.  We’ll need a good quality emulsion. Something that will hold. 

**EMILIE**
(Turning, her voice tight)
Holding is important. You know that.  Some things… they just crumble, don’t they? Without a solid foundation. 

She gestures vaguely towards the hole in the wall. 

**AMELIE**
(Looking away)
It's a rather noticeable hole.  We could patch it, of course.  Maybe with that textured filler?  It would give it a certain… depth. 

**EMILIE**
(Picking up the ruler again, tracing the tape with her finger)
Depth. Yes.  That’s precisely what it needs.  Layers.  You wouldn't want to just cover it over, would you?  Like… ignoring the cracks. 

Another pause. The sunlight shifts, casting long, distorted shadows.

**AMELIE**
(Almost a whisper)
When do you think we should start?  This weekend?  Saturday morning? 

**EMILIE**
(Looking at the wall, her gaze lingering on the outline of a photograph – a blurry image of Sam, smiling)
Saturday. Yes. It needs to be… deliberate.  We can't rush it.  There's so much to consider. The angle of the light, the texture of the plaster… 

**AMELIE**
(Her voice flat)
It's a difficult wall. 

**EMILIE**
(Turning back to Amelie, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes)
Difficult walls often hide the most important things.  The things you try to… conceal. 

She stares at Amelie for a moment, a silent accusation hanging between them. Amelie doesn’t meet her gaze. 

**AMELIE**
(Setting down her tea)
We should probably get the brushes.
