[SOUND of dripping water, distant city traffic, a lone crow cawing]

**(The courtyard is grey, the light fading to a bruised purple. Eleanor, a woman with hands roughened like river stone, sits on a low stone bench, sorting through a pile of linen. Vivian, slightly younger, her face etched with a similar weariness, is nearby, folding a damp shawl.)**

**Vivian:** (A small, weary laugh) Rover’s a good dog, eh? A real good dog. Like a shadow, he is. Always watching. 

**Eleanor:** (Without looking up, her voice low and gravelly) He is. Loyal. Like a stone. You know, he understands things… things people don't. 

**Vivian:** (Nodding slowly) He does. My Marco… he used to say the same about his donkey. Silly, really. A donkey. 

**Eleanor:** (She pauses, a brief, almost painful smile playing on her lips) Marco... he was a good man.  Simple. Like Rover. 

**(Eleanor reaches for her husband’s jacket, a dark, worn wool, draped over the bench. She brushes off a stray thread. Her fingers hesitate. A faint, crimson stain, almost invisible in the fading light, blooms on the sleeve.)**

**Vivian:** (Looking up, noticing Eleanor’s stillness) What is it, Eleanor? You seem… troubled. 

**(Eleanor doesn’t answer immediately. She examines the stain, her thumb tracing its outline. Rover, a scruffy, greyhound-like dog, lies patiently at her feet, licking her hand.)**

**Eleanor:** (Her voice flat, devoid of inflection) Just a mark.  Dust.  The rain. 

**Vivian:** (Eyes narrowed slightly) It’s… red. 

**(Eleanor gently strokes Rover’s head, a slow, deliberate motion.)**

**Eleanor:** (Her voice barely a whisper) He likes it when I touch him.  He doesn't mind.  He just… watches. 

**(A long silence. The dripping water seems louder now. Vivian observes Eleanor with a quiet, unsettling intensity.)**

**Vivian:**  You seem… composed.  For a woman seeing something like that. 

**Eleanor:** (She stands, smoothing the jacket with a practiced hand. Her gaze fixed on the courtyard wall)  A woman has to be composed.  Especially now.  Rover needs his supper. 

**(She picks up a small, worn wooden bowl and starts to fill it with scraps. Her movements are precise, economical.  Rover whines softly, nudging her hand with his nose. Eleanor ignores him, turning back to Vivian with a small, strained smile.)**

**Eleanor:**  He’s a good boy, isn’t he? A very good boy.  He doesn't ask questions. 

**(She pats Rover’s flank, a quick, almost desperate gesture. The crimson stain on the jacket remains, a silent, unsettling secret in the gathering dusk.)**
